\section{The .vossrc Default File}
\label{vossrc}

If the user puts a .vosrc%
\index{.vosrc}%
{} file in his/her home directory
or in the current directory, FL will read this file to set
a number of defaults.
Below we include a copy of the default .vossrc file which
also include the acceptable alternatives.
